atlas_cms_comparison.C
----------------------
Root macro to compare the rescaled 7 TeV Atlas upsilon xsections
with the 13 TeV CMS ones

combineXsec.py
--------------
Reads the upsilon ROOT files for Atlas and CMS from
../CMS_13_TeV/data and ../Atlas_7_Tev
and combines them into an output ROOT file

Plots made by atlas_cms_comparisons.C

ups*_combined.root
------------------
Root files with the pt spectra of upsilons combining
data from Atlas and CMS.  Files contain "central" value,
the "up" and the "down" variations
The normalization is dsigma/dPt in nb/GeV for the
rapidity interval abs(y)<1.2
