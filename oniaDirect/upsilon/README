atlas_cms_comparison.C
----------------------
Root macro to compare the rescaled 7 TeV Atlas upsilon xsections
with the 13 TeV CMS ones

combineXsec.py
--------------
Reads the upsilon ROOT files for Atlas and CMS from
../CMS_13_TeV/data and ../Atlas_7_Tev
and combines them into output ROOT file

make_pretty_plots.C
-------------------
Root macro to make plots from ups*_combined.root

ups*_combined.root
------------------
Made by combineXsec.py
Root files with the combined pt spectra of upsilons
from Atlas and CMS.  Files contain "central" value,
the "up" and the "down" variations
The normalization is dsigma/dPt in nb/GeV for the
rapidity interval abs(y)<1.2
