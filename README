-------------------------------------
To calculate branching ratios for various types of Dalitz decays
or various types of vector/onia decays:
    ./DalitzBR mass
    ./OniaBR mass
where mass is the mass of mCP in MeV.
The file decayMQ.C contains functions Do2BodyDecay and DoDalitz
to perform 2-body and Dalitz decays.
